<h5> About </h5>

<p>The Davis Sailing Team is a diverse group of university students with one thing in common: sailing. Although many of us also enjoy hiking, backpacking, 
  fancy food (just wait, you&rsquo;ll understand), flying, etc. If you haven&rsquo;t sailed before, don't worry! 
  Regardless of your skill level, we&rsquo;ll do our best to train you to be a competitive dinghy sailor. 
  As a member, you will be a fractional-owner of our 7 saibloats and equipment, with unlimited sailing access at the Lake Washington
  Sailing Club in West Sacramento and access to some of the best sailing instructors available for free: your fellow teammates! </p>
<!--
<p>As a member of the Davis Sailing Team, you receive unlimited sailing access and eligibility to participate in regattas. 
  We practice every week in Sacramento, and travel all over the West Coast for regattas. So come and sail!</p>

<h5> Eligibility </h5>

<p>If you are a current student and in good standing at University of California, Davis you are eligible to join the team. 
  You do not need prior experience to join but you must know how to swim.
  You must also be a member of our host sailing club, Lake Washington Sailing Club (LWSC), which entitles you to many other benefits. 
  Don't worry about not being a LWSC member, the team will assist you with this application process.

If you are an undergraduate student you will be eligible to sail in inter-collegiate and club events. 
However, if you are a graduate student, you can only compete in club events. However, everyone is encouraged to come to practice!</p>
