<h4> Gear </h4>

<p><h5>
Am I expected to bring my own gear?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>You are expected to bring your own gear. However, the team has a limited supply of extremely used foul weather gear that we loan to new sailors. We also have loaner life-jackets but they are not recommended for racing.
  </li>
  <li>There are many places to find affordable sailing gear, but if you can&rsquo;t buy actual sailing gear try finding substitutes! (Dry fit, surf booties, and gardening gloves are great substitutes!)
</ul></p>

<p><h5> If I don&rsquo;t have any sailing gear what do I need to bring to practice? </h5>
<ul>
  <li>Bring a bathing suit, towel, water, snacks, and a change of clothes. Plan to get wet.

<h4> Sailing Aspects </h4>

<h4> Teams </h4>

<p><h5> How do you make varsity? </h5>

</ul></p>

<p><h5>  What is the difference between JV and Varsity?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The JV and Varsity teams practice, travel and race together. The only difference between the team is in scoring and eligibility. There are both varsity only and JV only regattas the team attends.
</ul></p>

<p><h5> What is the difference between a student organization and a club or varsity sport?</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A student organization is student run, meaning we have no overseeing administrator. All our officers are students elected by our peers and are very aware of the students&rsquo; budget, time, commitment and needs. The officers also gain valuable leadership and resume experience which they would not receive on a varsity sport.</li>
  <li>As student organization, we are not only able to attend regattas without university restrictions but also maintain our equipment more efficiently. We cannot have our funding cut and we can receive donations.
</ul></p>
